# Calculator ðŸ§®

This calculator lets you do simple operations like additions, subtractions, divisions, multiplication, and converting a number to a percentage or a negative number. I made it as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, as the last assignment of the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).
